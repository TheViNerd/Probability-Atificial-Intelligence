/* two construction method used
Two clilque tree construction methods are implemented in bn.cpp:
1.Using VE:
cliquetree cliqueTreeCon(const std::vector<int> &order) const;

2.Using CG
cliquetree cliqueTreeConCG() const;

Both of them are implemented inside bn class. And they can be used by calling:
/*
    bn n;
    cliquetree ct;
    ct = n.cliqueTreeCon(order); or ct = n.cliqueTreeCG();
    cliquetreePrint(ct).//show detail information of clique tree
 */


/* test vetest.cpp
1. BN1, BN2, BN3, is generated using makeex(),makeex2(), and makeex3();
2. cliquetreePrint() can be used to print out the detail information of the clique tree

3. runtime test is used to compare the runtime
